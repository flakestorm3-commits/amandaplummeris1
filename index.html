	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>My interests are in design and cooking. I can't really cook, but I love finding different recipes to try as I'm getting better. Design is something I like 
	to keep improving in and I started getting into graphic design after high school when I was looking for my potential career in the future. As for hobbies, I like
	to write stories for fun and practice drawing. My goals at the moment is to finish my degree and start my career in graphic design. I thought of going freelance in
	the past and I'm still considering it, but I'm also looking into getting hired at a company.</p>
