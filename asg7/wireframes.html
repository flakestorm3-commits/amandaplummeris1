        <h3>Answers to the Questions:</h3>
        <p><strong>Advantages & Disadvantages Between Sketching & Software Wireframes:</strong> To start, the advantages of using Sketching Wireframe is that you can sketch up a wireframe with any medium at anytime while using Software Wireframes keeps you to devices and computers. Going down the list, it's faster becuase you are picking up a paper or whatever your chosen medium is and sketching down your wireframe idea in the moment with nothing ruining your flow. (<em>Though it is noted that software is getting faster overtime, so it might one day be up to par with sketching.</em>) It's flexiable since you sketch the wireframe on the same page or make adjustment to the lo-fi wireframe on the page to a higher one. Finally there are less distractions since you are focusing on the details of the wireframe, not things like the font of the text, color, or any further styles. <br> <br>The disadvantages of skeching wireframes, though, are that you can't duplicate the wireframe you sketched or reuse as a template for another project if they liked what they sketched or if it was simliar. The sketch wireframe will always be a lo-fi wireframe due to being unable to add media or animation to the wireframe like you can with software wireframes. It's also non-interactive like software wireframes, there is no timeframes or comments to determine when and what change was made to the wireframe, lack of collaboration due to it being done on paper and not on software where team members can see the edits and comment, there is no standardization, so elements can seem inconsistent, and, finally, there is the potential based on someone's sketching skills, that the sketching wireframe is ugly.</p>

		<p><strong>My Preferred Wireframe:</strong> With me, I prefer to you a software wireframe to make a design for my website. My reasoning is that I'm not the best at drawing and my drawing style is definitely not consistent. It's better for me to do it in a software where I have better experience and can go between lo-fi and hi-fi when I'm ready. It would give me a better idea of what I'm aiming for in appearance and where everything should be on the site as I code it.</p>
