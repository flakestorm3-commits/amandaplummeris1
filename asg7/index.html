        <h1>CatDog for Mayor!</h1>
        <h2>CatDog Biography</h2>
        <h3>Cat - <em>Felinius Meow Caticus</em></h3>
        <p>Cat is the older of the twins by five minutes, and behaves as such. Cat is the smarter, more clever and more cunning of the two. He often devises various plans to trick Dog into getting what he wants, such as making Dog smarter in an attempt to have more in common with him, or having him win a dog sledding contest by training him in a very hard and militaristic manner. Usually, as a result of his greed and selfishness, these schemes all blow up in his face. He is the "underdog" of the two. Life has been hard for the both of them, as they have been shunned by society due to their awkward appearance, but Cat always seems to get the short end of the stick in the situations, especially when faced with the Greaser Dogs. He doesn't like garbage trucks and balls. With his brains and constant ridiculing from the rest of the characters, he is the more defensive and short tempered of the two. Despite his quirks and spats with Dog, he loves his younger brother with his whole heart.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dog - <em>Caninius Woof Eugene Skippy Dogicus</em></h3>
        <p>Dog is the younger of the twins. Dog is the more happy-go-lucky and na√Øve of the two. He is also the source of clumsiness. He's an American Foxhound/Jack Russel Terrier, who is extremely ambitious when Cat or any other character convinces him to take on a task, diving right into it with full force and energy. Dog is a typical loyal dog and is easily convinced. He will believe everything he is told. His attention span is the very short and he is easily distracted by balls, garbage trucks, bones, food, dragonflies, and his overactive imagination. Because of his dysfunctional brain, Dog is usually the one who gets the pair into trouble. Not paying attention to Cat's warnings, his actions almost always end up with some severe consequences. Despite this, in many of the episodes, it is shown that Dog is usually the one that is more popular and athletic of the two, such as the episode when Cat and Dog both went back to school to complete Cat's last day of High School. Like Cat, Dog adores his older brother and looks up to him no matter how many times Cat steers him into danger.</p>

        <h3>Reasons CatDog Would Be Good Mayors</h3>
        <p>Despite CatDog's faults, they would be good mayors, especially compared to Rancid Rabbit. Cat would definitely try to spin the laws for his pleasure, but I feel like Dog would pull him back to make the laws fair for everyone once he realized no one was happy under whatever Cat was pulling off. Besides, as it says in Dog's bio, while Dog isn't the brightest, he is considered the popular kid, most people liking Dog. Even the Greasers like Dog despite them constantly beating on him, the gang admitting they just don't like Cat at some point. If they started running for mayor, Dog could be the face, people already liking him and Cat being the brains to make the laws and make sure Nearburg was better than it was under Rancid Rabbit. It would be a hard sale since Cat isn't the most liked, but with Dog heading the campaign and Cat providing promises for what the town would get if they were elected, CatDog would be good canidate for the Mayors of Nearburg.</p>

            <h3>Rancid Rabbit</h3>
            <p>Rancid Rabbit would be a good running mate against CatDog, not only because he is already the mayor of Nearburg, but also because he, like other residents of Nearburg is constantly trying to make CatDog's life hard. He would make a great advisary for them in the mayor race and he certainly would be playing dirty the whole time since he didn't stay the mayor of Nearburg for as long as he has with the stunts he has been pulling this whole time. For example, in the show, it's shown that Rancid has multiple jobs around town despite being the mayor and he has used those positions to make CatDog miserable. With Rancid as their running mate, it would be a hard one victory in the polls.

        <h2>CatDog's Top Platform</h2>
        <p>That's a hard one, but I think maybe they could be doing livestreams on different platform (<em>The world's equivalent to YouTube or Facebook</em>), Cat being the camera guy and telling Dog what to say on camera. Since CatDog don't have a good reputation in town, Cat might think to let Dog do the talking first. There might be some slip ups since Dog is Dog, but it would endear the people of Nearburg to him more since Dog is being more genuine than Rancid. Once they had everyone's attention, Cat would pop in, providing what they would do if they would do if they were elected as mayors of Nearburg. They will be posting on different social media, but their top platform might be Facebook on Dog's account.</p>
