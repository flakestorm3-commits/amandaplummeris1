	<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
	<h2>Difference Between Structured Content & Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>With structured content, I think from what I read in the article is how the website is structured, like confiming what something is on the page like
	what is type of header is on the page, the paragraph, and defining tags like the body. On the other end with semantic html, it conveys the meaning of the tags all
	together on the page, like the sections of the page. Like for example, whether what is on the page is an article, a navigation bar, or the footer of a page. </p>

    <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
	<p>They work together in where semantic html is needed to show what section the tags that the structured content provides are in on the webpage. Without the 
	semantic html, the content would have nothing to appear on in a manageable format that people can process and read. For example, if there was no clearly defined 
	navigation bar, the text that is the navigation buttons would just be text with hyperlinks, but not clearly defined in as the navigation section on the page.</p>
	
    <h2>Why It Is Important To Have Both for Web Pages</h2>
	<p>As mentioned in the previous section, both are needed to create a proper web page. If you were to just use structured content without semantic html, you would 
	get a website, but it would basic website like the ones we are making in class. With web semantics, it would split the website into sections to make it more manageable
	and visually appealing.</p>

	<h2>Question Answers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The method I think would be the most successful with me to banish the inner critic troll, which I think I've done some times, is the <em>Swith it Up</em>
		tatic. The issue with me is that I know deep down I can do things because I've been taught and trained in what I do, but I always have the critic or nerves 
		messing me up. Taking a moment to breath, ask questions on how to improve past my shortcomings, and ask why I should let these shortcomings stop me from trying, 
		does get me fired to get things done once I calm down.</li>
		<br>
		<li>From what I read, hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to get more rational when being forced to wait. In a way, it seems like when being forced to
		wait, it makes people rationalize more to chose the option that has the lesser wait time when given the option and it gets harder to wait for the better 
		payoff when the instant gratification is right there over time. One of the methods he mentions is by tricking your future self by doing something in the now to
		that works for both your present and future self. Like how he mentioned how someone's present self spend a lot of money for a food service, which worked out for
		them in the future. I guess I can work with that same method, because yeah, I might be like, I'll do it later, but I have no idea what my future self will be doing,
		so the thought kind of makes it easier for me not to give into wants since I really don't know what I might be doing later.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Thinking about it, maybe I have either Networking Power or Network Power. I can chose who or what is included in my work and I have a structural understanding
		of the power in protocols and standards in different mediams I may use to create my works.</li>
