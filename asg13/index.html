    <h1>Ideal Job Thoughts:</h1>
    <p>When it comes to jobs, I honestly at first thought I could handle a career in webdesign. While I understand some things to make my own website and I have experience with some webbuilders, I found my passion and experience lines better with graphic design. I've even done a few jobs where I've designed flyers and graphics for events and websites. I can't draw well, but I love using different programs to create the designs that fit the event and what my clients are asking for. Though, staying freelance has been on my mind, I have considered getting a job at a company since there are benefits that come with getting a job than working on my own. So, my ideal job would be a job where I either start as an intern in a company, working my way up as I learn what they are looking for, or a job that is looking for a graphic designer thant can work with other designer to provide the best work for clients.</p>

    <h2>Ideal Jobs:</h2>

      <p>I'm iffy about this job since the company listing is based in Florida from the looks of it, but when I looked up the listing, the search said it was potentially a remote position. If true, this would work out great, though I would have to ensure I had solid internet and a great computer to make it work. It also would be nice if I could work from home so I can keep the house for my parents and I wouldn't have to worry about driving to work everyday. Looking over the qualifications for the job and what they are looking for, I have the experience and it looks like they have a great enviorment to learn and grow my skills as well as working with other designers in the company.</p>

      <p>This job isn't a remote position, but it is within my area, so I can always get a ride to get there. I also like the structure that the job provide, the description of what they require clear. I will admit, my experience will be challanged, but I'm confident I can handle the work load. I like the idea of making the designs and getting real time feedback from clients and fellow employees. I can design well, but I always overthink my designs, so always having active critique helps.</p>

      <p>Again, another job challenging my experience, but it's a job that pays well and challenges everything I learned in college. They want someone to not only make graphics for their company, but all types of medias and they also would have me working with other people to provide the best multimedia assets. There is also opportunites for me to exercise my leadership skills because they would require me to lead some projects. Between the pay and the opportunites provided, I would have my hands full, but it certaintly would be a great trial by fire for me to do better.</p>
