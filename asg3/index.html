<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<h2>Question Answer:</h2>  
<ul>
  <li>This was a struggle since I didn't know of any sites with this problem and when I went searching, most sites I ran into didn't have the issue of having
  something unclickable that looked clickable. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>If you're talking about a website that I'm creating based on a problem, I guess the problem could be there are not a lot of options for websites dedicated to
a book series or book by an author. Like, maybe there is one good website, but what if a person wants to have more website like that that offer more than just
storing information about the genre and the author? The issue would be creating another website of that genre of website.</p>
<br>
<h3>Audience:</h3>
<p>The audience would be people who are booklovers and who would have love for a specific book series if I'm only creating a website dedicated to a specific series.
People looking to hear more details about their favorite author, details about the books in question, and any other detail they might want to hear about the series
and the author.</p>
<br>
<h3>Competition:</h3>
<p>The competition would be the existing book websites already based and having a fanbase that knows about them. It would be difficult to create a website that can
make itself original since it's basically the same thing involving providing a place where people who are fans of the series can come read details about the series
and the author.</p>
<br>
<h3>Key Messages:</h3>
<p>The key message could be about the book series as well as telling a story through the webpage. The message could follow how we feel about books and how easily 
we can get lost in the stories being spun. If the website was used to not only provide people information about the book series and the author, but also tell a story
of its own, that would drive the message home to people visiting the site.</p>
<br>
<h3>Call to Action:</h3>
<p>The Call to Action to get the audience interested in the project could be maybe a story built around the book series. Like, maybe start a social media feed posts
featured around a character that might be seen on the website, acting like someone who is archiving the book series. Of course, the issue would be I wouldn't be able
to provide an image of the person since my drawing abilities are not the best, but maybe it could work with just words. The site could also have a blog page area or a
newsletter page that gives updates that gives off the feeling of a newspaper. The idea is to constantly engage the audience and make the website have the potential to be a growing
story that is being told over time. Like maybe, at first, not every book is on the page and it's like the person is slowly archiving every book over time.</p>
<br>
<h3>How to Measure Success:</h3>
<p>To measure success would be difficult since putting a contact page might break the illusion on the website. Then again, maybe it could be the character's mailbox
where users can send mail to ask questions in world or suggest what book the character should aquire for the collection next. Another way to gauge interests and success
could be social media interaction. Like if a lot of people are responding to the posts with interests and questions, that shows interest in the website and gives active
feedback to how the audience feels about the page.</p>
