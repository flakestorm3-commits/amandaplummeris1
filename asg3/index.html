<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<h2>Question Answer:</h2>  
<ul>
  <li>This was a struggle since I didn't know of any sites with this problem and when I went searching, most sites I ran into didn't have the issue of having
  something unclickable that looked clickable. However, I do know sites that have issues with pop-up ads and auto-playing videos. One for this example is
  <a href='https://toolbaz.com/' target='_blank'>https://toolbaz.com/</a>.The issues is that the site, without an adblock, is nearly impossible to use because
  of the constant ads and videos playing in the background. It completely bogs down the website as the user is using the website. While I understand it's a free 
	site with AI engines, there has to be a way to incorporate ads without sacrificing function.</li>. 
  <li>To reframe my idea in a story format, it turns the websites into more than just a website that holds information about a book series and the author behind it.
  If the website was used to tell a story, I could have a character in the website, a mascot, that could be adding the books to the website. Like the idea, that not
  every book in the series is there at first. It's not much abstract as the story is being shown to the audience that visits the page. It's a simple story being told
  of a passionate fan archiving a series they love, but it's taking time since the world they are in makes it difficult to get ahold of the books in question, maybe. 
  It would just be interesting to see that the main page is a shelf of books, that is slowly feeling up over time as the character collects them. It would definitely
  make the website more than just a site holding information with the story being the basis of the site.</li>
  <li>When it comes to the different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design, one of the ways is point sytem which means the different sizes of the text can
	determine the typography hierarchy. Like the headers being bigger than the other text on the page. An example would be on this website: <a href='https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/meals-menus/g32264284/easy-dinner-recipes' target='_blank'>https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/meals-menus/g32264284/easy-dinner-recipes/</a>.
  	With typography hierarchy, emphasis is key, so besides using the size of the text to determine it, you can also use the weight of the text, the style, color, placement
  	and alignment to determine the typography hierarchy on the webpage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>If you're talking about a website that I'm creating based on a problem, I guess the problem could be there are not a lot of options for websites dedicated to
a book series or book by an author. Like, maybe there is one good website, but what if a person wants to have more website like that that offer more than just
storing information about the genre and the author? The issue would be creating another website of that genre of website. Though, it could be a website that not only
provides information about books and author, it could also be for people who want to write their fanfiction about the series to place their stories.</p>
<br>
<h3>Audience:</h3>
<p>The audience would be people who are booklovers, potential fanfiction writers, and those who would have love for a specific book series if I'm only creating a website 
dedicated to a specific series. People looking to hear more details about their favorite author, details about the books in question, wanting a place other than 
Fanfiction to place their stories, and any other detail they might want to hear about the series and the author.</p>
<br>
<h3>Competition:</h3>
<p>The competition would be the existing book websites already based and having a fanbase that knows about them. It would be difficult to create a website that can
make itself original since it's basically the same thing involving providing a place where people who are fans of the series can come read details about the series
and the author. However, the addition of a place for people to submit their stories to the site would definitely help the website stand out.</p>
<br>
<h3>Key Messages:</h3>
<p>The key message could be about the book series as well as telling a story through the webpage. The message could follow how we feel about books and how easily 
we can get lost in the stories being spun or the stories they are spinning. If the website was used to not only provide people information about the book series 
and the author and a place for their own stories in the world of the series, but also tell a story of its own, that would drive the message home to people visiting the site.</p>
<br>
<h3>Call to Action:</h3>
<p>The Call to Action to get the audience interested in the project could be maybe a story built around the book series. Like, maybe start a social media feed posts
featured around a character that might be seen on the website, acting like someone who is archiving the book series. Of course, the issue would be I wouldn't be able
to provide an image of the person since my drawing abilities are not the best, but maybe it could work with just words. The site could also have a blog page area or a
newsletter page that gives updates that gives off the feeling of a newspaper. The idea is to constantly engage the audience and make the website have the potential to be a growing
story that is being told over time. Like maybe, at first, not every book is on the page and it's like the person is slowly archiving every book over time. Then once the entire
series is collected, the character might say while she is done archiving these books, everyday, new books are still being archived, meaning the stories users are publishing on
the website.</p>
<br>
<h3>How to Measure Success:</h3>
<p>To measure success would be difficult since putting a contact page might break the illusion on the website. Then again, maybe it could be the character's mailbox
where users can send mail to ask questions in world or suggest what book the character should aquire for the collection next. Another way to gauge interests and success
could be social media interaction. Like if a lot of people are responding to the posts with interests and questions, that shows interest in the website and gives active
feedback to how the audience feels about the page.</p>
