<h2>Creative Brief</h2>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>If you're talking about a website that I'm creating based on a problem, I guess the problem could be there are not a lot of options for websites dedicated to
a book series or book by an author. Like, maybe there is one good website, but what if a person wants to have more website like that that offer more than just
storing information about the genre and the author? The issue would be creating another website of that genre of website.</p>
<br>
<h3>Audience:</h3>
<p>The audience would be people who are booklovers and who would have love for a specific book series if I'm only creating a website dedicated to a specific series.
People looking to hear more details about their favorite author, details about the books in question, and any other detail they might want to hear about the series
and the author.</p>
<br>
<h3>Competition:</h3>
<p>The competition would be the existing book websites already based and having a fanbase that knows about them. It would be difficult to create a website that can
make itself original since it's basically the same thing involving providing a place where people who are fans of the series can come read details about the series
and the author.</p>
