	<h1>AJR</h1>
	<h2>Biography </h2>
	<p><a href="https://ajr-music.fandom.com/wiki/AJR" target="_blank"> Wiki Fandom AJR</a> </p>
	<p>AJR is an American indie pop band that consists of brothers Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met (previously Metzger). They write, produce, and mix their 
		own material in the living room of their apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan.The brothers' parents are named Laurie Marvald and Gary Metzger , 
		both have worked as architects. Laurie was the original founder and manager of AJR, creating and developing the band. Laurie also was a co-founder 
		of AJR Productions, LLC and served as co-manager of the band until 2022. The 3 members of AJR grew up in Bayside, Queens until moving to Chelsea, 
		Manhattan in 2001. They attended the Professional Children's School in Manhattan. The brothers (supposedly) have Germananic origin, due to the 
		history of the Metzger surname. The brothers are also ethnically Jewish. In addition, in the introduction of the song World's Smallest Violin, 
		Jack sings "My grandpa fought in World War II, he was such a noble dude.", hinting that his grandpa was a Jewish fighter fighting for the Allies.</p>

	<h2>Why AJR?</h2>
	<p>Personally, I listen to all types of music and there's only a few I don't like. I only recently, probably last year or so, maybe, started listening to
	their music. I didn't know anything about them, still don't really know them, but I love the type of music and songs they were making. Especially the ones about mental stuff or just 
	their experiences in life like <em>Karma</em> and <em>Don't Throw Away My Legos</em>. Of course, the first song I've ever listened to of their work was the song
	<em>I'm Not Famous</em> and just heard the song through an animation and didn't look deeply into them until way later. Their songs are just fun and interesting
	to listen to to me.</p>
