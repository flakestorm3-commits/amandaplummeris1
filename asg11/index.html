		<h1>The Velocity Squad</h1>
	<p>This is the Velocity Squad, a group made of toons who are powerhouses in their own right and that I found a fun mix of characters for a dodgeball team. Flash is the squad leader and each member have their own strengths and weaknesses that make them great for a dodgeball team. Here's the rundown of this all-star team line-up!</p>
	<section class="grid">

		<h2>Flash</h2>

		<p>This chose is questionable since it is cheating since he's fast, but let's assume that he's nerfed a bit or Reverse Flash is on the other team to make it fair. With his speed and him being athletic, Flash would make a great pick in dodgeball, being fast and having a good arm. Flash would be the team leader of the team.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Lynn Jr. Loud</h2>
		<img src="images/lynnloud.png" alt="Lynn Loud">
		<p>Now, this is a fun pick! In the Loud House, Lynn is involved in all types of sports, being her team's best player in all sports from football, soccer, and basketball. To further prove her credentials, in the show, her coach rarely wanted Lynn to take off during an important game because he believed they would lose without her. With that track record, Lynn would is great pick for the team thanks to her athletism and ability to excel in whatever sport she finds herself in.</p>

		<h2>Scooby Doo</h2>
		<img src="images/scoobydoo.png" alt="Scooby Doo">
		<p>This pick is an odd choice given that it's a literal dog, but Scooby Doo has been involved in sports and is great at dodging. Referring to his history of sports, he competited and won a few rounds in the Laff-A-Lympics with his team. With his speed and throwing skills, Scooby would be great at dodgeball. Worse case if he doesn't throw well, he can catch the ball to bring back his teammates. Though, his teammates might have to make sure he doesn't get distracted by food during a match.</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Bugs Bunny</h2>
		<img src="images/bugsbunny.png" alt="Bugs Bunny">
		<p>Bugs Bunny is picked for the team because he has participated in sports before (<em>Space Jam 1 & 2</em>) and the fact that in his normal life and adventures, he's fast and clever in his own right. If he got in a dodgeball fight, he would most likely be the one dodging the balls or catching them to get the team mates back on the floor. Not to mention, taunting the rival team to get them to make mistakes or bad calls during a match.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Richard Watterson</h2>
		<img src="images/richard.png" alt="Richard Watterson">
		<p>The last pick for the team was difficult to think of, but then I remembered an episode with Richard that makes him perfect for this dodgeball team. During one of the episodes of the Amazing World of Gumball, Richard participates in a game of dodgeball and he is suprisingly skilled at it. On top of that, despite how he acts in the show and his size, Richard is suprisingly agile and strong, making him another star dodgeball player on the team.</p>
