		<br>
		<p>The movies I like as you can tell are mostly animated films. When I was thinking of what my favorite movies are, I was struggling a bit since I haven't really been watching any movies lately for one reason or the other. However, after digging around my thoughts and online, these are my favorite movies. My reason is because some are funny or just have fun stories that I like. That and a few of these I watched when I was kid either on Cartoon Network or on a tape my parents bought.</p>
