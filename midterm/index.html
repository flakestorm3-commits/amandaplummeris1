  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, and welcome to The Shire! Well, not actual the actual Shire. Getting there is a little different than just checking a webpage, I'm afraid. Takes a lot of steps that are a bit difficult. However, while this page can't <strong>take</strong> you to the Shire, it certainly can tell you all about it if you are interested in vacationing there for a while to see the sights and meet the locals. I know I am! As you go through each page, I'll give a rundown of what you can look forward, too! Hope you have a great time learning about the Shire!</p>

  <h2>About The Shire:</h2>
  <br>
  <p>The Shire is the homeland of hobbits that is a land of rolling hills and farmlands. The locals are hobbits, but they are a friendly bunch and welcome visitors to spend time in their homelands to unwind and enjoy the local nature and cuisine. Regardless of what season you visit the Shire in - spring, summer, autumn, or winter - the landscape is always wonderful to look at and there's always something to do whether that's hanging out with friends or doing activities around the Shire. There is also</p>

  <h2><strong>Fun Facts:</strong></h2>
  <br>
  <p>1. A bit of hobbit history. The Shire was originally a royal hunting ground before hobbits were granted the land in TA 1601 after the Great Plague by the king.</p>
  <br>
  <p>2. While staying in the Shire, you start to notice the architcture of the buildings and homes. Hobbits are known for their round doors and windows, a practical feature retained from their earlier tunnel-dwelling days. <p>
    <br>
  <p>3. Given the fact that hobbits forage from nature around their homeland, they have an inordinate fondness for mushrooms, and their favorite drink is pipe-weed.</p>
  <br>
  <p>4. Though the Shire is considered the homeland of the hobbits today, they did not originally come from the Shire. Their original homeland was the Vale of Anduin, near the Misty Mountains.</p>
