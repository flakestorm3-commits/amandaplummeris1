    <h2>The Shire's Clubs</h2>

    <img class="main" src="img/clubicons.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>In the Shire, there is never a short supply for what you can do everyday. For one, the Shire has a series of clubs that visitors can participate in during their stay. Starting off, we have the Gardening Club run by a hobbit named Rosie Cotton, who is a member of the Cotton family who are the Shire's best farmers. You can earn badges and the like as you learn about garderning and maybe even grow your own produce or plants. The same goes for the other clubs in the Shire. There's a Fishing Club where you can improve and have fun fishing is run by the local fishing expert hobbit, Old Noakes, the Cooking Club where you can learn how to cook is run by the cook and innkeeper of the local resturant, <em>The Green Dragon</em>, Lily Cotten, and lastly, the Foraging Club where you will learn how to forage for plants and mushrooms in the Shire is run by a hobbit named Delphinium Brandybuck, who is the local herbalist and healer.</p>
  <br>
    <p>As you can already tell, there is plenty to do and learn in the Shire during your trip and there is much to earn in each of the clubs. By the end, you will have plenty of badges to reflect your time in this wonderful land.</p>

    <p>Hobbits love to have and share meals in the Shire, a good meal being a great way to make friends with a hobbit.

    <h2>Hiking & Exploring</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Lastly, as you do all these wonderful activies in the Shire, there was many places around the Shire to explore. To encourage visitors to explore, hobbits may give riddles that relate to a location or landmark that a guest has to figure out. You can even meet with friends to explore and figure out what the riddles mean. Along the way, you will learn more about the Shire's history and the history of the hobbits who have lived there as well as the people who had the land before it was gifted to the hobbits. Make sure to bring plenty of food and water for a day of hiking and exploring the Shire!</p>
