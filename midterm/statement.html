  <h1 class="title">My Statement</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Starting off, I kept things simple for the website because I was struggling to remember concepts and struggling to make certain code work the way I wanted it to, so I just leaned into that. Most of the site is straightforward with nothing fancy going on, with most of the personality coming from the text. For the typeface, I wasn't going for anything special. I just wanted the headers to have special font, so I looked for fonts for display and came across the 'Gravitas One' and liked how it looked. I wasn't too pressed about how the main text of the site had to look so after searching through the san-serif section of the font site, I wound up picking 'Narnoor'. Then when I was experimenting with the colors I chose for the website, I turned the text white so they could be better seen against the darker colors.</p>

  <br>
  <p>Next up, is the text placement and size. That took me a second, but I decided on each page, the h1 tag needed to be made into a special tag because I wanted to text to be centered and bigger than the other text on each page. I liked how it turned out. As for the rest, again, kept it simple and just adjusted the margins on everything to make sure everything was spaced properly on the page. For the color palette, I looked up 'the Shire color palette hex code' or something like that and came across a webesite that had the colors and code for that fit the Shire. I liked the colors since it felt fitting and I just liked the mix of greens and browns. Of course, I didn't use all the colors. I made the main site green, used the darker green for for nav bar, and I used the brown color for the footer and the introduction box. White was used for the text and black for when you hover over the nav bar.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As for image, I tried to be uniformed with each image I placed on the page because I was once again struggling to do what I intially had in mind. So I just gave every image a set height and width and made sure they were all set to go the near the center of each page. I also picked a logo image to add the animation to. As for button style, I wasn't going for anything fancy, so the button on the contact page is a normal button to click to submit the comments with the button centered under the contact us boxes. Another thing is had to make up the final resturant location from a real one because as far as I could tell, there was only two resturants mentioned in the lore of the Shire. Overall, the website may be simple, it does paint a wonderful picture of the Shire as a vacation spot.</p>
