  <h2>The Green Dragon Inn</h2>
  <br>
  <p>The Green Dragon Inn is the most popular inn of Bywater, a small town in the Shire, frequented by Hobbits and visitors for a good meal during the day. The inn is run by the Cottens, a family of farmers and the own and led by Lily Cotten, being the cook of the inn. Most hobbits gather there in the evening to enjoy her meals and her famous pies. While meals are shared around town in different locations, many would recommend a stop at the Green Dragon to enjoy Lily's famous meals. As mentioned before, Lily is the leader of the Cooking Club in the Shire and also the inventor of the town's special: the Bywater Pie, a pie that can have any flavor. They all look the same, but one bite can reveal a different flavor. So if you drop by the inn, you might find yourself getting your first taste of the Bywater special!</p>

  <h2>Ivy Bush Inn</h2>
  <br>
  <p>The Ivy Bush Inn is a small inn in the Shire that is more of a waterhole where hobbit and people alike can come to share a drink and talk. There is food to be had there, but drinks and room to rest is the Ivy Bush Inn's speciality. Many hobbits around the Shire frequently came here to drink and socialize with one another. One of its usual patrons was Hamfast Gamgee, more commonly known as "the Gaffer" around the Shire. The Ivy Bush was where the Gaffer explained Frodo Baggins' history and connection to Bilbo Baggins, so if you are interested in a good drink, company, and a story to go along with it, the Ivy Bush is a good place for it!</p>
