	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Three Things I Learned:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>From the article about the evolution of web, I did know most of those things, at least the basic idea of it, but I did
		not	know about how web was developing in the Web 3.0 age and further past that. I'm curious to see how it all develops over
		time since the idea to give users their privacy back.</li>
		<li>While reading everything, I do know most of the concepts of where web design started and where it's kind of going. I 
			also agree with The Wax and the Wane article about constantly getting ready to learn, experiment and adapt as we learn more
			different ways to make a web site. However, I did not know, at least not fully, the difficulty of constantly checking 
			for updates and making sure it does not kill the web site you are making or have made. I have worked with making web sites 
			but I haven't ever thought deeply about that.</li>
		<li>Lastly, for the chapter, again, it was a struggle since I did know most of it of the details in the chapter. Like the idea 
			web sites are considered a type of art and the other uses of web design. However, the summearizes of the chapters does include
			topics I would love to learn about like Chapter 6 and 7. I could stand to learn more about the history of the design work
			of CSS and the like and what deceptive design is.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
	<p>It's kind of up in the air for me what kind of website I want to create, but it could either be a site that holds information
		about a story series I like, like Sherlock Holmes or a blog site possibly that could be for me to post short stories for writing 
		exercises. Of course, if the second option is too much, I found I struggle with backend web design, then I'll do a website around
		a book series I like.
