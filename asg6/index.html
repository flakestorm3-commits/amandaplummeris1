	<h1>The Six Thinking Hat Summaries</h1>
	<h2>White Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>Facts</em></h3>
	<p>What I discussed with the person I wound up talking to is the information I have right now is the ideas for the website I want to create and the information I need is potential websites that are simliar to what I want to do. What I'm missing is more knowledge about the things I want to do. Like I wanted to add a fanfiction section where users can add their own stories, but I'm not entirely sure how to implement that where it works for me and the users. We guessed to get the information I need, I need to dig deeper and keep searching up information and look up example of websites that hide things in plain sight.</p>

	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>Feeling</em></h3>
	<p>I'm feeling excited about this! I love the idea of telling a story and making a mystery through a website and it would be amazing if I can pull this off. The hunches and intuition I have is around how such a website would work. Like the moment I came to the idea, I had a hunch of how such a website would work and I got happy and excited as I slowly wrote out the idea for the website. I am a bit anxious about it too since it is a big job, but I want to be able to put such a site together.</p>

	<h2>Black Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>Negative Logic</em></h3>
	<p>What doesn't work, even though I really wanted it to, was the fanfiction idea for the site. The idea was that website was to be telling the story of an alternate world where the character on the site is trying to archive the books of a series. To give users a way to further immerse themselves in the world, I was going to provide a fanfiction tab where they can submit their stories and people can read. The issue is my coding knowledge is not the best so I might not be able to code to make a proper fanfiction area. That and if I did,depending on what system I used, to prevent users from publishing something inappropriate, I would to manually check each submission and it might take a mental toll on me. So, do the issue on earthed, I decided in the end if time runs out, this feature just might completely cut.</p>

	<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
	<h3><em>Positive Logic</em></h3>
	<p>However, despite the previous statement, what does work is the idea of having mystery on the website, which is easier to implement. This has value because it is a way users can still engage with the website because there are hidden secrets on the website. Whether it's hidden words or an item hidden it locations on the website that don't look clickable, the user can slowly learn more about the world the character lives in and what the character is facing past the details of the character collecting books in a world that doesn't make that easy. For one, I know how to make hidden text on the page and part of the fun is finding fun and creative ways to hide links on the page that lead to items and hidden lore. Of course, I need to make a lorebook to keep track of everything, but that's part of the fun.</p>
